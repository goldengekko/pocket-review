// TODO: Move location to a separate entity? Ola? Do not think it is necessary. Will we ever have anything else then the location on this entity

// TODO: I removed several things from the web.xml and spring-security.xml to understand how it works. Add back stuff that is needed as we add security


// TODO: There is a bug in Mardao with caching.


Current

// TODO: Describe JSONP on Wiki

istället för POST
GET /api/..../?_method=POST&param=...
[8/21/12 6:55:37 PM] Ola Sandström: GET /api/....?_method=DELETE
[8/21/12 6:56:29 PM] Ola Sandström: @RequestMapping(...., method="GET", params="_method=POST")


// TODO: Comments has to do with ratings, not product. Can we support both?


// TODO: Create email text using velocity templates instead?

// TODO: Add a common exception handler that translate into HTTP response codes

// TODO: Simple backoffice interface (sigin, get all registered apps, new, delete, update)


The backoffice will work like this:
-The user signs in with gmail account
-If it is a new user a new DApplicationAdmin will be create
    -State will be set to pending
    -An email will be sent to X telling there is a pending user
    -The new user will get a screen telling them to wait for approval
-A GAE project admin logs in and browse all pending users
    -Admin can approve, this will send an email to the pending user
    -admin can Suspend and Delete (users can no longer access the app admin page, will the app still work for the service?)
-The new approved user login and will see a list of all their registered app domains (DAppDomain)
-The user can select to:
    -Create a new domain. Must be unique and will be stored in DAppDomain
    -Select and existing app domain and be taken to the Application settings (stored in DApplication)

The DAppDomain and DAppAdmin will reside in a special namespace the same for all applications (in order to access all data at the same time)
The DAppSettings will reside under each domains namespace (will thus only be one per domain)

// TODO: Implement the "most" operations
// TODO: Remove support for Old RatingController, changes are so big it is not possible to maintain backwards compatibility

// TODO: Update to new version of Mardao (refactor caching)

// TODO: Do not use pending state, active directly (just send email)
// TODO: Check the url structure once more, does not seem right
// TODO: Check all PUT and POST and GET
// TODO: Only lower case parameter names in the http request

// TODO: Merge branch to master after Olas reviewed and approved changed.


// TODO: Use session in backoffice security (better performance) - Ola, I guess we should not have session on backoffice users. They are authenticated outside the system. - NO
// TODO: Move domain to before the "app" in REST - Nja, can figure out a good name when it comes to "mine" and "all"
// TODO: Byt till POST
// TODO: Change REST URL rated/most /rated/me rated/top etc
// TODO: User something better then then "user" on the REST  - use office
